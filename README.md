# Hello there! üëã

I'm a seasoned software developer with 13 years of professional experience, deeply rooted in the .NET technology. Throughout my career, I've primarily contributed to various projects in the financial industry, where I've honed my skills and deepened my understanding of this domain.

## üíº Professional Journey

As of now, I hold the position of Solution Architect at a prestigious financial company. This role has allowed me to leverage my extensive experience in .NET to design and implement robust, scalable solutions that drive the business forward.

## üåê Community Engagement

Beyond my professional endeavors, I'm actively involved in the .NET community as the leader of the [Krakowska Grupa .NET](https://www.meetup.com/kgd-net/) meetup group. This initiative has enabled me to connect with like-minded individuals, share insights, and learn from the collective wisdom of the community.

## üìù Blogging and Knowledge Sharing

I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge and experience, which I do through my blog at [https://cezarypiatek.github.io/](https://cezarypiatek.github.io/). Here, you'll find a wealth of information on Roslyn, along with best practices in software designing and testing. My aim is to empower developers to write cleaner, more efficient code.

## üõ† Open Source Contributions

I believe in the power of open source as a means of learning, sharing, and collaborating. You can find several projects on my profile, where I contribute to the community with tools and libraries designed to enhance productivity and solve common development challenges.

## üöÄ Commercial Products

Among my creations are [Productivity Boost Snippets](https://store.mappinggenerator.net/b/productivity-boost-snippets) and [MappingGenerator](https://mappinggenerator.net/) ‚Äî tools designed to streamline the development process and improve code quality. These products reflect my commitment to innovation and efficiency in software development. You can support my work by purchasing a licence.

## üé§ Speaking Engagements

Occasionally, I step into the role of a speaker at meetups, where I share my insights and experiences with emerging technologies, project best practices, and more. These sessions are a fantastic opportunity for me to engage with the community and foster a culture of continuous learning. Links to some of my talks end performances are available [here](https://cezarypiatek.github.io/public-speaking/).
